# Story Collection

This project was based on the code written for a secret diary web service that uses PHP and mySQL. I changed it to simply the interaction, split the reading and writing into two different folders.

## Setup

To setup this service on your web server you need to:
 
 1. Setup a database and run ``mySQL.sql`` on your MySQL server to create the required data structure.
 2. Specify the login details for the database in the config.php file (and customise the other parts of it as needed).
 
 I'm sure I've forgotten something, but I think that should be it.
